## :warning: Disclaimer :warning:

This test is not 100% fail proof and should not be the sole reason of failing the assignment.
Fails written in _Yellow_ are not as important since they are **stressing** tests, they are only to test the worst cases of your program.
This tester bases itself on the outputs given by your program, hence you will have issue if you use specific or custom error messages.
This tester is mostly useful to see where your program fails so that you can fix those cases.
